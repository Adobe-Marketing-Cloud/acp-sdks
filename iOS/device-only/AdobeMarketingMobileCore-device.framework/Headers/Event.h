     * @class Event
     *
     * @brief An Event indicates that something notable happened and includes relevant information about what happened.
     *
     * Creating Events
     * ----------------
     *
     * Events are created using EventBuilder:
     *
     *     auto event = EventBuilder{"the_event_name", EventType::ANALYTICS, EventSource::REQUEST_CONTENT}.Build();
     *
     * Events can also be created via cloning using Event::Copy():
     *
     *     auto event2 = event.Copy();
     *
     * Event Properties
     * ----------------
     * Events carry the following pieces of information:
     * - _Name_ is a descriptive string for an individual event. Primarily used for logging.
     * - _Type_ is an EventType that identifies what happened.
     * - _Source_ is an EventSource that identifies the origin of the event.
     * - _Pairing ID_ is a string that, when set, uniquely identifies this event. A one-time listener can register on this
     *   pairing id for 1:1 communication.
     * - _Response Pairing ID_ is relevant for events that follow a response-request pattern. When set, identifies the
     *   pairing ID that should be used for responses to this event.
     * - _Number_ is an integer sequence number. Used primarily for debugging.
     * - _Data_ is an EventData, an associative map of string keys to values of various types. Used to convey additional
     *   information.
     * - _Timestamp_ is the time at which the event was generated.
     *
     * Dispatching, Processing, and Listening for Events
     * -------------------------------------------------
     * To dispatch events, a module will typically subclass ModuleEventDispatcher and invoke EventHub::Dispatch().
     *
     * To listen for events, a module will typically subclass ModuleEventListener.
     *
     * To process (change) events,  module will typically subclass ModuleEventProcessor.
